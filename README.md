# Depker

## Introduction

Depker (**dep**loyment, doc**ker**) is a deployment tool based on Docker, designed to lower the difficulty of automating application deployment for low-performance self-hosted servers, and provide continuous deployment capabilities.

## Features

- No server-side support required.
- User-friendly terminal interface (providing colored output and supporting tty mode).
- Deployment templates (enabling deployment of different applications through different templates).
- Quick access to logs (accessible without the need to remote into the server).
- Quick command execution (linking to containers to execute commands without the need to remote into the server).
- Support for Traefik.
- Support for Docker Pipeline (to be implemented).
- TypeScript type support (to be implemented).

## Installation

```shell
npm i -g @syfxlin/depker

一些注意事项：

- Depker is currently in the early testing phase, and its API may change at any time.
- The documentation is currently being improved. Please use the 'help' command to get assistance for now.
- Depker runs locally, but it is still recommended to backup important data before performing any operations to avoid accidents.
